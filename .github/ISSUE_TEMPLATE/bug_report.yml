        Use this issue template when you are pretty sure here is a bug. 
        Make sure the trouble you are experiencing haven't been already reported earlier and haven't been talked about in [discussions](https://github.com/Waujito/youtubeUnblock/discussions).

        Note, that *bugs* are internal program errors: crashes, freezes and other types of undefined behavior. You may also report problems with routers infrastructure here, but **NOT** questions like *My router doesn't work help please*. Your questions and other stuff with custom routers setup should be discussed [here](https://github.com/Waujito/youtubeUnblock/discussions/172)

        Discuss problems like *youtube doesn't unblock* [here](https://github.com/Waujito/youtubeUnblock/discussions/173)
